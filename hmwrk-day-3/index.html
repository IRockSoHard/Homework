			<p>Welcome to the Life of Titen!  My name is Lee and i would like to thank you for visiting
			my about me page!  Lets get to know Lee - I was born in Tampa Florida and was adopted by a
			wonderful family, the Titens.  To skip ahead past all the boring stuff I live in beautiful 
			Castle Rock, Co and enjoy the small city living compared to a life downtown.  I have had
			many jobs and a few careers throughout my life (to name a few, chef, EMT, Therapist/life 
			coach and of course helicopter mechanic) but i am here today to tell you I may have found 
			finally my niche!  I live for video games and I love computers, so I quit my latest life
			as a helo machanic and started school at General Assembly to become a full-stack developer!
			I'll be back regukaryl to update my progress here so come back soon to see the most
			amazing portfolio you'll ever know!</p>
